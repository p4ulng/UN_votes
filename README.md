# UN_votes

Project seeks to Answer the Question of How has the UN’s voting patterns evolved over time, and what notable trends and times of division can be observed? How closely do countries’ votes on these issues align with major powers such as the United States of America, China and Russia? By exploring these trends, we aim to reveal how international alliances change and where consensus or division is present and how a country might change its stance across time.
